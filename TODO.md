# Todo

## Will do


## Might do

* Keep sending notification/sounding noise until interrupted
* Allow spaces between number and time unit
* View and/or stop currently running timers
* Re-run previous timer

(The thing is, I've never actually needed to use these features, so maybe they're unnecessary)

## Could do, I guess??

* Create intervals (e.g. pomodoro)??
* Save and name timers/routines
* Pause timers?

## Notes

* May need a build process to include dependencies in alfred asset?
