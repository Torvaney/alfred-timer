# Todo

## Will do

* Keep sending notification/sounding noise until interrupted
* Allow spaces between number and time unit

## Might do

* View and/or stop currently running timers
* Re-run previous timers


## Could do, I guess??

* Create intervals (e.g. pomodoro)??
* Serialize timers (so that long-running timers can be persisted/resumed on restart etc) if needed??
